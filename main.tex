\section{Introduction}
CoPilot serves as your driving companion. It is a dashcam which records your driving scene in high resolution. 

Moreover, different than any dashcam on the market, CoPilot has also traffic light alert system built in. It alerts the driver about the current traffic light status, using cutting-edge machine learning technology. 

One more thing, when parked, a survailence mode can be activated, it will record the scene if motion is detected in the camera view. This gives your car another safety guard when parked in public, and collect evidence for hit-and-run incidence.

\section{Hardware Overview}
CoPilot consists of a 8MP front facing camera as its main sensor, in the enclosure it contains a raspberrypi 3 and a real time clock. Two speakers are located on the sides for mode indication and voice alerts.

\end{figure}

\clearpage
On the back is a machine learning hardware accelerator for fast inference, and a Mode Selection button for switching between different modes. 
A small button for muting the voice alert is also available.

\section{Mode Selection}


\begin{table}[h!]

\begin{tabular}{c|c|c}
    Mode & Indicated Sound & Model Section Button\\\hline
    Basic Alert Mode (Default)& "Visibility Clear" & Press once \\\hline
    Experiment Alert Mode & "Speed to Full" & Press twice \\\hline
Surveilance Mode & "Standing By" & Press three times 
\end{tabular}

\subsection{Basic Alert Mode (Default)}
A subset of functionalities of the traffic light alert system will be activated.

\begin{tabular}{c|c}
\hline
    Scenario & Voice Alert \\

\hline
     \includegraphics[height=0.15\textwidth]{pics/green_to_yellow.png} & \begin{tabular}{c} "Yellow no rush"\end{tabular} \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\label{tab:gt}
\end{table}

\subsection{Experiment Alert Mode}
Full functionalities of the traffic light alert system will be activated. It includes all the alerts from Basic Alert Mode, but also has more alerts shown below, where as soon as CoPilot
sees the first appearance of a traffic light it will alert its state.

Note that due to the early stage of development, the false positive alert can significantly increase. Consequently it might disturb the driver while driving. Therefore this mode is not the default mode.

\subsection{Surveilance Mode}

  \caption[]{Record on motion detection.}
%\end{figure}
\end{wrapfigure}
Suitable for parked scenario, no traffic light alert in this Mode. 

A recording of the scene will be created only when motion is detected.

Note, in this mode, you might need to use an extenal power source like a power bank, since the in car USB power supply usually turns off when car is parked.
